Make the praline
Before you start, chop the cashews and almonds and keep them ready to go.
Add sugar to a wide pan on medium-low heat. Don't stir it, at first the sugar will get clumpy.
But eventually it will melt completely and become smooth.
As soon as sugar melts and caramelizes (light golden in color), add the nuts to it. Stir to combine the nuts. Be very careful here, the caramelized sugar is very hot. Also sugar can burn very quickly once it's melted so as soon as it caramelizes, stir in the nuts and remove from heat.
Transfer the sugar nut mixture onto a parchment paper and let it cool down. You can also use a any bowl/plate here but make sure to grease it well before pouring the sugar mix into it. Let it cool and solidify completely.
Once the sugar-nut mixture is completely set and hard, break it into few pieces and transfer it to a food processor. Pulse few times until you get a powder with some coarse pieces. Don't turn this into a fine powder, you want some big chunks of praline for texture. Set the praline aside.

Make the ice cream
Now take the mixing bowl of your stand mixer (or any bowl in which you are going to beat the cream) and keep it in the refrigerator along with the whisk attachment for 20 to 30 minutes. Then take out and add heavy cream to it. Using the wire whisk attachment of your stand mixer or using your hand mixer, beat the cream until it forms soft peaks. Set aside.
To a large bowl, add 3/4 of a 14 oz. can of condensed milk, milk powder and Indian butterscotch essence. Mix until everything is well combined. You can also add a drop of yellow food color here if you want.
Now add some of the whipped cream into the condensed milk mixture and fold it slowly using a spatula.
Add all the whipped cream into the condensed milk mixture in parts â€“ mixing slowly after each addition. Don't mix very vigorously here.
Once the whipped cream and condensed milk mixture is well combined- add the prepared praline to it. You can reserve some to sprinkle on top while serving. Mix using a spatula until all the praline is well mixed with the ice cream base.
Transfer the ice cream to an ice cream container or any container you want you freeze your ice cream in. Freeze for 6 to 8 hours or preferably overnight.
Serve butterscotch ice cream in cone or cup, you can sprinkle some of the reserved praline on top for extra crunch!
